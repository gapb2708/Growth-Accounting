# Growth Accounting

In this repository we analyze the economic growth of 4 hypothetical countries.

First, we have a data set of the GDP per capita for each country. All countries start at the same level.

We define the average growth rate for each country as:

$$r= ( \dfrac{GDP_{0}}{GDP_{T}}) ^{1\dfrac{1}{t_0-T}} -1$$
